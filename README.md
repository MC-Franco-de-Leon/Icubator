The main goal is to extract such information from a social network such as e-Toro

In this notebook I present two figures. 

## The first picture 

Is the word frequency after removing stop words. As we can see in this exploration, there are punctuation signs that we will add to our stop word list.  Then we see words such as "bitcoins", "transaction", "http"

## For the second picture 
We analyze the lexical dispersion plot of the words "bitcoin", "mining", "profitable", "America", "http"

In this project we will detect good investors by analizing their predcitions vs their time series. I think that analyzing the sources "http" of the investors we can infer if they are well informed or not.
